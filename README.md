# MATERIAL TESTING USING DATA SCIENCE AND COMPUTER VISION

## Material Test Report (MTR)

A Material Test Report (MTR), also known as a mill test report, acts as a certified record of a material’s physical and chemical properties. These qualities are necessary for assuring proper compliance, reporting, and application purposes. Standards, such as ANSI and ASME, that require MTR certs ensure that manufacturers are working with materials suited for their intended purpose. Failure to accurately communicate a material’s physical and chemical properties can lead to issues that may result in catastrophic failure or even loss of life. This is why MTRs are of critical importance during and after manufacturing processes.

## Current Method of Reading  Material Test Report (MTR)

The initial review of an MTR begins with a physical inspection of the material on the shop floor or in the warehouse. The heat number should be physically present and identifiable on the material’s surface. This number is then compared with the associated MTR to ensure the two match. Simple surface and edge measurements will further confirm this material conforms to project requirements based on physical dimensions and thickness.

##Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system capable of automatically detecting and recognizing plate IDs, heat numbers, and dimensions from steel plates in an industrial environment. The system will use image processing techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to extract alphanumeric information and dimension measurements. The detected information will be saved in an Excel sheet for easy data management and traceability  

 

Project Goals: 

1.Develop an object detection and localization algorithm to identify steel plates within the camera's field of view. 

2.Implement optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to read the plate IDs and heat numbers from the detected plates. 

3.Ensure robustness and accuracy of the system to handle variations in plate positioning, lighting conditions, and character styles. 

4.Integrate real-time video feed from cameras to perform plate detection and recognition in a dynamic industrial setting. 

5.Provide a user-friendly interface to display the detected plate information and save the results to a database or export them to a file for traceability and record-keeping purposes. 

6.Achieve a high level of automation to reduce manual intervention, save time, and improve overall productivity in steel plate identification and tracking processes. 

7.Evaluate and optimize the system's performance to achieve real-time processing speeds and high accuracy in reading plate IDs and heat numbers. 

8.Test the system in a real-world industrial environment to validate its functionality, efficiency, and reliability.
